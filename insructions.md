Create a simple API using the following stack - nodejs, express, mongodb and other needed tools.

The API would be called nolewood API and its purpose would be to fetch nigerian movies and tvshows using the YouTube API.

The results would need to be categorized firstly by movie or tvshow/series, these are the main categories.

Subsequently

Content-Based Categories

Genre/Theme Detection

Analyze titles and descriptions for keywords indicating genres (romance, action, comedy, drama, thriller)

Movie Series/Parts

Group movies that are part of the same series (often indicated by "Part 1," "Part 2" in titles)
Create collections of related content

Language/Dialect

Categorize by primary language (English, Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa, Pidgin)
YouTube provides language tags that can be supplemented with your own analysis

Production-Based Categories

Production Companies

Group by production houses
Create showcases of studios with the most popular content

Directors and Producers

Categorize films by directors
Highlight prolific or award-winning directors

Cast-Based Collections

Create actor filmographies
Identify frequent collaborations between actors

Engagement & Metrics

Popularity Tiers

Group by view count ranges (viral hits, moderately popular, niche content)
Use like-to-view ratios to identify highly engaging content

Trending Content

Use publish dates and view velocity to identify trending movies
YouTube provides trending metrics you can leverage

Audience Reception

Use like-to-dislike ratios (if available) and comment sentiment analysis
Create "highly rated" or "audience favorites" collections

Age/Recency

Categorize by release year or era
Create "classic" vs "new release" collections

Derived Categories

<!-- Content Similarity Clusters

Use NLP on descriptions and titles to group thematically similar content
Create "if you liked X, you might like Y" recommendations -->

<!-- Cross-Referencing

Create intersectional categories (e.g., "Comedy films starring [Actor]")
Build relationship graphs between cast, directors, and production companies -->

Seasonal/Holiday Content

Identify content related to holidays or seasons
Group content that was published during specific seasons or events

To implement these categorizations effectively, you might need to:

Build additional NLP pipelines to extract more detailed metadata
Create hierarchical category structures in the database
Implement recommendation algorithms based on these categories

These data would be gotten from youtube and stored on a mongodb database to prevent excess calls to the youtube API although a cron job should be initiated on 24hrs intervals to update the db.

For searches, search keywords should check for movie titles and actor names and return movies that match the keyword search.

If a search returns no result from the mongodb automatically search directly from youtube API as well to prevent empty search results when items searched are not on db but are existing on youtube.

Create a readme file that explains the API thoroughly.

Create a separate documentation file that programmatically instructs and guides a developer on how to use every aspect of the API in an in-depth manner.
